# Genetic Algorithms

## Intro 
Monkey writer is based on the infinite monkey theorem which
states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a keyboard for
a infinite amount of time will eventually type any given text.


## The c program

The monkeywriter_parallel.c is a parallel version of the genetic
algorithm that solves problems like the monkey writer for a finite
piece of text. It implements a standard genetic algorithm.


## The standard genetic algorithm

The standard genetic algorithm consists of
initialize a population, evaluate it according to an fitness function
and generate a new population based on the individual with the highest
score, iterate til the fitness function returns its maximum value.
